NORMALIZE.JAR
##########################################################

normalize.jar performs the following operations:
	1. normalizes each feature between 0 and 1;
	2. discards conflicting vectors (i.e. vectors which have similar features, but belong to opposite classes);
	3. removes null vectors
	
Usage example:

	java -jar normalize.jar <path> -c [true/false] -n [true/false] -z [true/false]
	
To run the examples that I sent you, do the following.

If you just want to normalize the vectors, do the following:

	cd examples
	java -jar normalize.jar ./experts/ -n true -c false -z false

If you just want to remove conflicting vectors, do the following:

	cd examples
	java -jar normalize.jar ./experts/ -c true -n false -z false
	
If you just want to remove null vectors, do the following:

	cd examples
	java -jar normalize.jar ./experts/ -z true -c false -n false

To run all functionalities:

	cd examples
	java -jar normalize.jar ./experts/ -z true -c true -n true
